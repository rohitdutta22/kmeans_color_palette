First Download everything and put it in a single directory.
Then just run the R script 'kmeans.R'. If you don't have the libraries used in the code, then you need to install them by the function 'instsall.packages()'

In this code I have used the painting 'van_gogh_img130.jpeg' to produce the color palette. Two more .jpeg file are also given for checking, you can use them too 
to get color palette of the corresponding image
